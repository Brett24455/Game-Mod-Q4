There are 5 components to this Zombie Escalation mod.
1. Weapon Changes
2. Upgrade Kiosk for weapons and perks
3. Zombie Waves
4. Added perks for the player
5. Displaying the high score. High score is the highest wave reached.

- Upgrade Kiosk
To access the upgrade kiosk, open up the console with CTRL+ALT+~. Once this is opened, type "buy " followed 
by the name of the item you wish to buy. The names of all the items in the shop can be accessed by the commands
"buy list", "buy weaponlist", and "buy perklist". Your currency is displayed on the bottom right of the hud,
labelled "Points". the 3 list arguments will also display how many points are required to purchase each weapon.
Having enough points will prompt "Purchased!" in the console, and "Insufficient funds." otherwise.

- Zombie Waves
To start a zombie wave, open up the console again and type "startwave now". Pressing enter will cause the wave
of zombies to spawn a certain distance infront of you. NOTE: do not call "startwave now" when you are too close
to a wall that you are facing. The first wave will start with a single grunt, and after every wave an extra grunt 
will spawn (Note: Due to performance issues with Quake 4 and killing multiple enemies at once, I needed to cap
the amount of zombies spawned to 6 at wave 6). 

- High Score
High score will begin at 0 when you start up the game, but will display the actual high score once "startwave now" 
(i.e. when the game mod starts) in the top right corner.

Weapon and Perk Descriptions
////////////////////////////////

- Weapons (brief descriptions)
MR6 - Shitty starting pistol with low ammo
Lcar 9 - automatic pistol. Effective but no ammo.
KN44 - Your bread and butter machine gun
Haymaker 12 - Automatic shotgun. Do not need to reload each slug individually
War Machine - Grenade Launcher. Explodes on impact anywhere. Fast and good but limited ammo.
Ray gun - Explosive pistol. Its ok. "Revive me I have ray gun".
Drakon - Semi Automatic Sniper Rifle. Its unbalanced as fuck and very fun.
L4 Siege - Rocket launcher with 4 rockets in the magazine. Rockets reload 2 at a time.
Wunderwaffe - 1 shot zaps zombies no matter what. Sadly not accurate to original wunderwaffe
due to the chain lightning mod sucking ass in Quake 4 and lagging or crashing the game if
multiple enemies are killed with it
China Lake - Grenade Launcher. It sucks. Thought I might as well add it cause its funny how 
often you need to reload.
Thunder Gun - The cream of the crop of my weapon modifications. Absolutely beautiful. I fucking
love it. Fun as hell. Shooting it will blast all the zombies in a short distance away NO MATTER
WHAT. Top tier weapon, an absolute must have. I just find it funny to see all the enemies get
blasted away with what seems to be compressed air. I apologize for the long gushing description.

- Perks (brief descriptions)
Juggernog - Max Health changed from 100 to 200
Staminup - Allows the player to run really fast when holding shift.
Double tap - Increases all weapons fire rates
Double double tap - doubles the hitscan of all KINETIC weapons (MR6, KN44, Lcar 9, Haymaker 12, Drakon)
Speedcola - Makes your weapon reload instantly as soon as it runs out.
